# 05/10/22 - Checking how P:C ratio affects the PCA of traits

# As previosuly there are 4 versions of the analysis

# PCA1 (M9) – male PCA with 9 traits (actually only 8, as TL is missing)
# PCA2 (F9) – female PCA with 9 traits equivalent to males
# PCA3 (Fmax) – female PCA with all 12 female traits
# PCA4 (FmaxPlus) – female PCA with 13 traits (12 female traits + viability)

# As before: I am uploading the Rscript, the rdata for the whole script, rdata for each PCA object (from which various summaries can be extracted), the individual coordinates as csv tables, and pngs of the output: each png is a panel with bi-(vector)plots on the left and coordinate plots on the right (either just for PC1 vs PC2, or PC1 vs PC2 + PC1 vs PC3).

# The pdf in the folder does some side-by-side comparisons of the previous analysis (all data) with this analysis (P:C controlled)
