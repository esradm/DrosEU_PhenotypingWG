# I'm including the R script, the Rdata for the various PCA outputs (different combinations of traits wrt sex differences) and the Rdata for the whole script.

# Otherwise please do email me! And for interpretting the PCA results, maybe we can discuss this once we have settle on which version of the analysis we go with.
