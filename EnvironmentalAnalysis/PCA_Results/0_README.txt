# I am deleting old versions of the files, as we have decided to focus on seperate sex analyses. There are 4 PCAs to consider: 1 with the male data and 3 with different combinations of traits in the female data:

# PCA1 (M9) – male PCA with 9 traits
# PCA2 (F9) – female PCA with 9 traits equivalent to males
# PCA3 (Fmax) – female PCA with all 12 female traits
# PCA4 (FmaxPlus) – female PCA with 13 traits (12 female traits + viability)

# I am uploading the Rscript, the rdata for the whole script, rdata for each PCA object (from which various summaries can be extracted), the individual coordinates as csv tables, and pngs of the output: each png is a panel with bi-(vector)plots on the left and coordinate plots on the right (either just for PC1 vs PC2, or PC1 vs PC2 + PC1 vs PC3).

# I'm including the R script, the Rdata for the various PCA outputs (different combinations of traits wrt sex differences) and the Rdata for the whole script.

# This has been done in a bit of a rush, so it is probably not as well annotated as it could be, but the analysis is not too complex, so hopefully it's still clear.

# Otherwise please do email me! And for interpretting the PCA results, maybe we can discuss this once we have settle on which version of the analysis we go with.
