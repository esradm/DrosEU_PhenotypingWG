# DrosEU_PhenotypingWG

Envel and I  will take care of pull requests once a week on Fridays, starting on 29th April, together with feedback from non-GitHub users. Please only push the file(s) that you have made a change (not the whole repository), and please do not merge any pull requests, in case I/we need to integrate feedback from other sources.
