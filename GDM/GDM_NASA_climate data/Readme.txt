I used Bioclimate variables that Venera converted from NASA data and the rest of data also were same as data that Venera downloaded from NASA.
 
There is no final map (Visualizing multi-dimensional biological patterns) for NASA data as they only offer estimated point. Thus, we cannot make raster map.


Method and result summary.docx is not cover these data, but the method is same.
